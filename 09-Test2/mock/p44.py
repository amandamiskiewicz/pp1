'''(p4.py) The dictionary contains the names of subjects and the grades obtained. 
Create a function f(subjects) that, for the given subjects and their grades, 
returns the name of the subject for which the average grade is the highest. Example:
f({"math":[3,4,4],"geo":[5,4,4,4],"comp":[5,4]}) ïƒ  "comp"
